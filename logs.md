## Class 3 — [Date]

*What we did:*
- Changed the layout of the course page. Added a top nav with sections, hero header, profile card, assignments/projects areas, weekly log, resources, and footer. Also added a dark mode toggle.
- Inspected babson.edu and used some of the structure/layout ideas for the new page.
- Created an **images** folder and added my profile photo. Replaced the "VS" placeholder in the profile card with the actual picture.
- Ran the site locally (python server on 8080) to preview. Committed and pushed everything to GitHub.

*Notes:* Page feels more like a real site now. Need to fill in weekly log and assignment details as we go.
